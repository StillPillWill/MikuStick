## 10/21/2025 - Laid the foundations  

- I was supposed to do this a while ago but I wanted a good milestone. Okay, so I started by prototyping hollow shells out of that translucent filament, varying the thickness and certain infill patterns to get the desired diffusion effect. Then I started laying out the wiring for the project. I decided to add a lithium ion battery and usbc for easy charging (so I wouldn't have to keep soldering the wires on the battery if it ever ran out of power) Also I added this a DC barrel jack coupling for easy prototyping so I could switch out the top easily. Also I added a switch so I could turn it on and off easily. Now some points of improvement
- The handle dimensions were off so the top and bottom donâ€™t mesh
- The LEDs are overdrawing and I need a resistor!
- I forgot to cut out a hole for the switch
- the plastic was too thin in some places so it broke
- The wiring was a mess and shorted occasionally
- Bulky and off center
